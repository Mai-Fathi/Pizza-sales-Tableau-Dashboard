# Pizza Sales Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of pizza sales data for a restaurant, using Python for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization.

## Overview

We aimed to uncover insights into pizza sales, including:
- Best and worst-selling pizzas
- Order times throughout the day
- Profit and cost analysis
- Popular pizza types and toppings

## Data Cleaning

Using Python and pandas:
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values
- Extracted date and time from order timestamps
- Calculated total cost, revenue, and profit

## Analysis and Visualization

In Tableau, we created an interactive dashboard to visualize:
- **Top Seller:** [specific pizza name]
- **Least Popular:** [specific pizza name]
- **Peak Order Times:** [time range]
- **Most Profitable Pizza:** [specific pizza type]
- **Popular Toppings:** [list of popular toppings]

## How to Use

1. **Clean Data:** Run `pizza_sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter to clean the data and save it as `cleaned_pizza_sales.csv`.
2. **Visualize:** Open `pizza_sales_dashboard.twbx` in Tableau to view the dashboard.
